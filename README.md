# crowdfunding101
A crowdfunding app for making targeted contributions. This is my first attempt working with strip API integration.

USE CASE:
- A basic page provides a link to user to make contribution towards a particular campaign.
- First redirection: User is prompted to enter credit card detail which gets validated and processed by Stripe API.
- Second redirection: User is redirected to a new page after successful transaction.
